## Explain how GitHub Projects and Kanban can help your group in future projects like your MS- ACS Directed Graduate Project or other group projects.
 With the knowledge gained in creating kanban in GitHub which will helps us in creating Jira board for our future projects . We have learnt to divide the work into smaller task and we created a stories based on that . It becomes easier to update the status of individual tasks, track the completion, and measure the overall project progress. This transparency allows for better project visibility We have learnt the significance of having a clear visualization of the different stages of work (To Do ,In progress, Done), By regularly updating the status of cards and moving them through the workflow columns, we gain insight into the project's progress.<br>

We also came to know the importance of team collaboration which is a key to the success of the project. With the help of Microsoft Teams we had a communication in which we provided feedbacks on the work done with in our team members which helped to improvise our work for the fruitful outcome. We used to have a scrum meetings daily in order to know the status of the work done by each team member and if there is any difficulty being faced by the team member the Project manager guided them to resolve the issue. The knowledge and experience we gained in this project will help in our future projects and we will be able to finish the task before the deadline.




## Describe what you learned about organizing various stories in GitHub Projects and using the Kanban board to manage your group project.

GitHub Projects will offer a structured approach of  organizing the project tasks. We have  learnt the importance of breaking down a project into smaller, manageable stories or tasks. By creating separate cards for each story, we can focus on the individual components/task. By assigning stories to specific group members, we come to know the value of task ownership and accountability. Each person will come to  know their responsibilities and can track their progress individually. This promotes a sense of ownership and ensures that tasks is  completed in a timely manner.<bR>

GitHub Projects allow us  to prioritize stories by using labels or assigning due dates(By creating Milestones). This teaches us to  gain the skill of prioritizing tasks and managing the time effectively, we will learn to identify the critical tasks and ensure that  they are completed on time to meet project deadlines.<br>

The Kanban board provides a visual representation of the  project's workflow. We have learnt  the significance of having a clear visualization of the different stages of work (To Do ,In progress, Done), By regularly updating the status of cards and moving them through the workflow columns, we gain insight into the project's progress. This will helps us to  understand the progress of each story and identify any blockers or bottlenecks that need attention immediately.<br>

**4. In general, how did it go:** <br>
Creating a Kanban board in GitHub will be challenging. As Kanban is an agile methodology n which we can perform the task parallely.It been  an effective framework for organizing and managing project tasks, fostering collaboration, and enhancing project visibility. However, we had a careful planning and had a group meetings via the Microsoft teams in order to discuss the status of our project. We had divided our work into smaller, actionable tasks and visualize the workflow from start to finish and we ensured that deadlines and milestones are met. 

**5. What was the most difficult part:** <br> 
Familiarizing ourself with the concepts of kanban and  how we  apply to our project  made us to consume a lot of  time and efforts in understanding it .Its been a tedious task for both of our team members to accomplish this assignment. In order to achieve this we require a thoughtful planning and consideration of the specific requirements of what to do and goals of our project. The most difficult thing we felt was making the team members images to same images pixel heights and ensuring the name  will be displayed corresponding to the team members.<br>
**6. What was most interesting:** <br>
We find it more interesting to do Research and analyze the tasks related to kanban and improvise the things into our project. Kanban boards will offer a visual representation of the workflow, allowing us to see the progress and status of tasks at a glance. This visual aspect makes it engaging and exciting for us  to track the movement of tasks across different stages, witnessing the project's evolution in real-time. This collaborative environment helped us to have  better communication, coordination, and a sense of shared ownership among the team members. It enhances teamwork and encourages collective problem-solving, which can be intellectually stimulating and productive for the project.

**7. What are the best parts of your group's submission (what are you most proud of):**<br>

 The best part of our group submission could be the clear idea of our project workflow. Our group had an effective task management and collaboration among ourselves.  Efficient task tracking and completion were key achievements, as we consistently updated task statuses and moved the cards across columns, ensuring progress aligned with our project milestones. We are proud that the complete project has been handled by only two team members, which is difficult task and a big achievement for us.
